Repo for my Ansible Playbook to run when a fresh install is done to take some of the tedium out of the twice-annual Windows reinstalls.

## List of Things I Install
In somewhat of a loose order:
### Personal
- 1Password

### Work

## Tasks to Automate
- Driver updates
- Installs of as many apps listed above as I can swing
